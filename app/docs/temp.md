To add your Next.js website to Azure, you typically deploy it as a web app using Azure App Service. Here’s a high-level guide:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repo (if not already).
2. Create an Azure account and log in to the Azure Portal.
3. Create a new “Web App” resource.
4. Choose a runtime stack (Node.js, matching your Next.js version).
5. Connect your GitHub repo to the Web App (Deployment Center).
6. Azure will build and deploy your app automatically.

For static export (if using next export), you can use Azure Static Web Apps instead.

Let me know if you want step-by-step instructions for a specific method (App Service or Static Web Apps) or if you want to deploy directly from your local machine!
